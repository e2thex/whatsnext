# User Story: Unified Dependency Interface

As a user, I want a single, intelligent interface for managing all types of dependencies so that I can quickly and intuitively add both task and date dependencies without having to navigate through separate, clunky interfaces.

## Meta Data
| Section | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| Completed | ✓ |
| Epic | Task States |
| Priority | High |

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✓ Users can access a single unified interface for managing all dependencies
2. ✓ The interface intelligently detects whether the user is typing a date or task name
3. ✓ Users can type natural language dates (e.g., "tomorrow", "next week", "in 3 days")
4. ✓ Users can type date formats (e.g., "12/25", "2024-01-15", "14:30")
5. ✓ Users can type days of the week (e.g., "monday", "next friday")
6. ✓ Users can type task names and see real-time search results
7. ✓ Users can press Enter to quickly add the first available dependency
8. ✓ Users can click anywhere on a suggestion to add it as a dependency
9. ✓ The interface provides intelligent date suggestions based on user input
10. ✓ The interface shows visual feedback for detected dates
11. ✓ Users receive immediate feedback via toast notifications for all operations
12. ✓ The interface supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
13. ✓ Loading states provide clear feedback during operations
14. ✓ All dependencies (task and date) are displayed in a unified list
15. ✓ Users can remove any dependency with a single click

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. ✓ The interface should be intuitive and require minimal learning
2. ✓ Date parsing should be intelligent and support multiple formats
3. ✓ Search should be debounced to prevent excessive API calls
4. ✓ The interface should be fully accessible via keyboard
5. ✓ Loading states should provide clear feedback during operations
6. ✓ Error handling should be user-friendly with helpful messages
7. ✓ The interface should be responsive and work on all screen sizes

## Dependencies

1. Task dependency system
2. Date dependency system
3. Task search functionality
4. Date parsing and validation logic
5. Toast notification system
6. Keyboard navigation support

## Implementation Notes

### Smart Input Detection
- **Date Detection**: Uses regex patterns to detect date-like input
- **Task Detection**: Falls back to task search when input doesn't match date patterns
- **Natural Language**: Supports conversational date expressions
- **Multiple Formats**: Handles various date and time formats

### Intelligent Date Parsing
- **Natural Language**: "tomorrow", "next week", "next month", "in 3 days/weeks/months"
- **Time-based**: "tonight", "this evening", "this afternoon", "this morning"
- **Day of Week**: "monday", "next friday", "tuesday"
- **Date Formats**: "12/25", "MM/DD", "MM-DD", "YYYY-MM-DD"
- **Time Formats**: "14:30", "HH:MM"
- **Smart Logic**: Automatically adjusts year for past dates, sets appropriate default times

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Unified Interface**: Single modal for all dependency types
- **Smart Suggestions**: Context-aware suggestions based on input
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows detected dates and loading states
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Enter to add, Escape to close
- **Full Row Clickability**: Click anywhere on suggestions
- **Toast Notifications**: Immediate feedback for all operations

### Accessibility Features
- **ARIA Labels**: Proper labels for screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling in modal
- **Semantic HTML**: Appropriate roles and structure
- **Screen Reader Support**: Clear, descriptive labels

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debounced Search**: Prevents excessive API calls
- **Efficient Parsing**: Fast date parsing without external libraries
- **Query Invalidation**: Proper cache management with TanStack Query
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during operations
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages

### Technical Implementation
- **React Components**: Functional components with hooks
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing throughout
- **TanStack Query**: Efficient data fetching and caching
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive, accessible styling
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback system

### User Workflow
1. User clicks dependency button on a task
2. Unified modal opens with smart input field
3. User types either a date expression or task name
4. Interface automatically detects input type and shows relevant suggestions
5. User can press Enter for quick addition or click specific suggestions
6. Interface provides immediate feedback via toast notifications
7. All dependencies are displayed in a unified list for easy management

### Benefits Over Previous Interface
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Single interface instead of separate sections
- **Faster Workflow**: Smart detection and keyboard shortcuts
- **Better UX**: Natural language input and intelligent suggestions
- **Improved Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Enhanced Feedback**: Loading states and toast notifications
- **Unified Management**: All dependencies in one place
