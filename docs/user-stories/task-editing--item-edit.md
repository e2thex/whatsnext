# User Story: Edit Task Inline
As a user, I want to be able to edit task titles and descriptions inline so that I can quickly update information.

## Meta Data
| Section | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| Completed | âœ“ |
| Epic | Task Management |
| Priority | High |

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Each task title and description is editable directly in the task list using the SlateTaskEditor component.
2. When a user clicks on a task title or description, it transforms into a rich text editor powered by Slate.
3. Changes are saved automatically when the user clicks outside the editor or presses Ctrl/Cmd + Enter.
4. If the user cancels the edit (e.g., by pressing the Escape key), the original text is restored.
5. The editor provides a rich text interface with formatting options and visual feedback.
6. The first line of the content is treated as the task title, and any subsequent lines are saved as the task description.
7. Users can add rich text formatting, including links, bold, italic, and other supported styles.
8. Validation is applied to ensure that titles and descriptions are not empty.
9. Users receive feedback through toast notifications when changes are saved successfully.
10. The editing functionality works seamlessly in both mobile and desktop views.
11. Users can type "@" while editing to see a dropdown of available tasks and add them as dependencies.
12. The editing interface includes a subtask management section with add, edit, reorder, and delete capabilities.
13. Drag and drop functionality is disabled during edit mode.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. The SlateTaskEditor should be performant and responsive to user interactions.
2. The user interface should remain intuitive and easy to navigate during editing.
3. Performance should not degrade when editing tasks with long content.
4. The implementation should follow TypeScript best practices with strict typing.
5. Components should be small, focused, and follow functional programming principles.

## Dependencies

1. SlateTaskEditor component
2. TanStack Query for data management
3. Supabase for backend storage
4. TailwindCSS for styling
5. Toast notifications for user feedback
