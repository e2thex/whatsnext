# Task Due Dates

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to set due dates for tasks so that I can manage deadlines and priorities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can add a due date to any task
- Users can edit or remove due dates
- Due dates are displayed prominently on tasks
- Tasks approaching their due date should have visual indicators
- Overdue tasks should be clearly marked
- Users can sort and filter tasks by due date
- Due dates should be considered in task prioritization

## Implementation Details
- A date picker will be added to the task edit interface
- Due dates will be displayed in a consistent format
- Color coding will be used to indicate due date status:
  - Green: Due date is more than a week away
  - Yellow: Due date is within the next week
  - Orange: Due date is within the next 48 hours
  - Red: Task is overdue
- The task list view will include an option to sort by due date
- A new filter option will allow viewing tasks by due date ranges (today, this week, this month)
- Due date information will be included in task cards and list items
- An optional notification system will alert users of approaching deadlines

## Technical Approach
- Add a due date field to the task data model
- Implement date validation to ensure due dates are valid
- Create utility functions to calculate due date status (upcoming, imminent, overdue)
- Build a responsive date picker component that works across devices
- Implement date-based sorting algorithms
- Create filter functions for date-based queries
- Ensure timezone handling is consistent across the application
- Implement a cache for date calculations to optimize performance
