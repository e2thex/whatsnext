# Task Archiving

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to archive completed tasks so that I can maintain a clean workspace while preserving history.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can archive completed tasks with a clear UI action
- Archived tasks are not shown in regular task views by default
- Users can view archived tasks when needed
- Archived tasks maintain their hierarchy and relationship data
- Users can restore archived tasks if needed
- Archiving a parent task should provide options for handling its children

## Implementation Details
- An archive action will be added to the task context menu
- Only completed tasks can be archived
- A dedicated "View Archive" option will be added to the main navigation
- The archive view will maintain the same visualization options as the main task view
- A "Restore" action will be available for archived tasks
- When archiving a parent task, users will be prompted with options:
  - Archive the parent and all its children
  - Archive only the parent and promote children to the parent's level
  - Cancel the operation
- Archived tasks will be stored in the same database but with an "archived" flag
- Archived tasks will not count toward progress calculations in parent tasks

## Technical Approach
- Add an "archived" boolean field to the task data model
- Implement filters in all task queries to exclude archived tasks by default
- Create dedicated UI components for archive/restore actions
- Build a separate archive view that reuses existing task visualization components
- Implement batch operations for archiving task hierarchies
- Add confirmation dialogs for archive operations that affect multiple tasks
- Ensure archiving operations maintain referential integrity for dependencies
