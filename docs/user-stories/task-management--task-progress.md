# Task Progress

## User Story
As a user, I want to see task completion status reflected in parent tasks so that I can understand progress at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Parent tasks should visually indicate the completion progress of their child tasks
- Progress indicators should show the percentage of completed child tasks
- Progress should be calculated recursively through all levels of the hierarchy
- Progress indicators should update in real-time when child tasks are completed or uncompleted
- The visual representation should be intuitive and easy to understand at a glance

## Implementation Details
- Progress will be represented using a progress bar or similar visual indicator
- The calculation will be based on the number of completed child tasks divided by the total number of child tasks
- For items with multiple levels of hierarchy, the calculation will consider all descendant tasks
- Tasks with no children will either show 0% or 100% progress based on their own completion status
- The UI will use consistent color coding to distinguish between different levels of progress
- Progress indicators will maintain accessibility standards for color contrast
- Animations will be used for progress changes to provide visual feedback

## Technical Approach
- Create a recursive function to calculate completion percentage for any task
- Implement reactivity to ensure progress indicators update when any descendant task's status changes
- Optimize calculations to prevent performance issues with deeply nested hierarchies
- Store progress data in state rather than recalculating on every render
- Use event delegation to efficiently handle updates across the task hierarchy
