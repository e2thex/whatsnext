# User Story: Completion Status Filtering

As a user, I want to be able to filter tasks based on their completion status so that I can focus on completed or uncompleted tasks as needed.

## Meta Data
| Section | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| Completed | ✓ |
| Epic | Task Organization |
| Priority | Medium |

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can filter tasks based on completion status (All, Todo, Done). ✓
2. The filtering UI is intuitive and provides clear visual feedback about the current filter state. ✓
3. Filters can be easily toggled between All, Todo, and Done states. ✓
4. The filtered view updates instantly when filters are changed. ✓

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Filter controls should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices. ✓
2. Filter state changes should be visually apparent to users. ✓
3. Filter controls should be accessible via keyboard. ✓

## Dependencies

1. Depends on [Tool Bar](tool-bar.md) for UI integration. ✓

## Implementation Notes

- Completion filter controls have been implemented in the Toolbar component in `app/components/Toolbar.tsx`
- Filtering is applied in the ItemList component
- Completion filters include:
  - All: Show both completed and not-completed tasks
  - Todo: Show only not-completed tasks
  - Done: Show only completed tasks
- The filters are implemented as a segmented control for intuitive toggling
