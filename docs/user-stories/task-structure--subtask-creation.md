# Subtask Creation

## User Story
As a user, I want to create subtasks under existing tasks so that I can break down complex work into manageable pieces.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can create a subtask under any existing task
- Users can create multiple levels of subtasks (nested hierarchy)
- Users can see the parent-child relationship between tasks
- Users can create subtasks from the parent task's context menu
- Users can create subtasks through drag-and-drop
- Users can see the number of subtasks for each parent task
- Users can collapse/expand subtasks in the view
- Users can promote a subtask to a main task
- Users can demote a main task to be a subtask

## Implementation Details
- "Add Subtask" option in task context menu
- Drag-and-drop interface for creating subtasks
- Visual indicators for parent-child relationships
- Subtask count badge on parent tasks
- Collapse/expand controls for task hierarchies
- Promotion/demotion controls for task hierarchy
- Keyboard shortcuts for subtask operations
- Success/error notifications for subtask operations
- Visual feedback during drag-and-drop operations
