# User Story: Tree View

As a user, I can see a tree view of tasks, with subtasks being shown as children of their parents, so I can understand the hierarchy of the whole system.

## Meta Data
| Section | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| Completed | âœ— |
| Epic | Task Organization |
| Priority | High |

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can toggle between tree view and list view with a clearly visible control
2. Tree view displays tasks in a hierarchical structure with proper indentation
3. Parent tasks are clearly distinguishable from their children
4. Subtasks are visually connected to their parent tasks
5. Users can expand/collapse parent tasks to show/hide their children
6. The tree view maintains proper alignment and spacing regardless of depth
7. Tree view respects the current filtering settings (actionable, blocked, completion), Parents are visible  if theire children are returned
8. Tree view works with search functionality, Parents are visible if their children are returned
9. Tasks in tree view maintain all their interactive capabilities (completion, editing, dependencies)
10. The tree view preference persists across sessions

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Tree view should load efficiently even with deep hierarchies
2. The transition between views should be smooth and responsive
3. The view toggle control should be intuitive and accessible
4. Visual hierarchy should be clear and not overly consume screen space
5. Expand/collapse animations should be smooth and performant

## Dependencies

1. Task hierarchy implementation
2. View state management
3. Task filtering system
4. UI component library with tree view capabilities

## Implementation Notes

### View Toggle
 - see ./layout-switching

### Tree View Structure
- Implement a recursive component structure for rendering the tree
- Use proper indentation to show hierarchy levels
- Implement visual connectors between parent and child tasks
- Add expand/collapse controls for parent tasks

### Visual Hierarchy
- Use consistent spacing and indentation for each level
- Implement visual indicators for parent/child relationships
- Use subtle background colors or borders to group related tasks
- Ensure proper alignment of task elements across different levels

### Expand/Collapse Functionality
- Implement smooth animations for expanding/collapsing
- Store expanded/collapsed state for each parent task
- Allow bulk expand/collapse operations
- Maintain scroll position when expanding/collapsing

### Performance Considerations
- Implement virtual scrolling for large trees
- Optimize rendering of deep hierarchies
- Cache expanded/collapsed states
- Use efficient data structures for tree operations
