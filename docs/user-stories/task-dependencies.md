# User Story: Task Dependencies

As a user, I want to mark that a task is blocked by another task so that I can ensure tasks are completed in the necessary order.

## Meta Data
| Section | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| Completed | âœ“ |
| Epic | Task States |
| Priority | High |

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can mark that one task is dependent on the completion of another task
2. Tasks that are blocked by dependencies are visually indicated as blocked
3. Users can see which specific tasks are blocking a task
4. Users can see which tasks are being blocked by a specific task
5. Blocked tasks cannot be marked as complete until their dependencies are resolved
6. When a blocking task is completed, dependent tasks automatically become unblocked
7. Users can remove dependencies if they are no longer relevant
8. Dependencies can be created between any two tasks, regardless of their position in the hierarchy
9. Users can add multiple dependencies to a single task
10. Task dependencies persist across sessions and page refreshes

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Dependency management UI should be intuitive and accessible
2. Visual indicators for blocked tasks should be clear and prominent
3. Adding and removing dependencies should be straightforward
4. The system should prevent circular dependencies
5. Dependency relationships should be efficiently stored and retrieved

## Dependencies

1. Task completion system
2. UI components for dependency management
3. Data persistence for dependency relationships
4. Circular dependency detection algorithm

## Implementation Notes

### Dependency UI
- Implemented a dependency button with a color-coded indicator (red for blocked, green for blocking)
- The indicator shows the count of dependencies in each direction
- Clicking the button opens a dependency management menu
- The menu shows lists of blocking and blocked tasks
- Users can add new dependencies or remove existing ones from this menu

### Dependency Data Model
- Created a many-to-many relationship between tasks using a `task_dependencies` table
- Each dependency record has `blocking_task_id` and `blocked_task_id` fields
- The database includes constraints to prevent circular dependencies
- Task dependency state is recalculated when tasks are completed or dependencies change

### Visual Indicators
- Blocked tasks show a red dependency indicator with the count of blocking items
- Tasks that block others show a green dependency indicator with the count of blocked items
- Blocked tasks have a visual treatment that shows they cannot be completed
- Completed tasks that were blocking others are shown with strikethrough in the dependency lists

### Dependency Logic
- When a dependency is added, the system checks for circular dependencies
- When a blocking task is completed, all its dependents are reevaluated
- A task is considered blocked if any of its dependencies are incomplete
- The dependency state is propagated up the hierarchy (parent items are blocked if all children are blocked)

### User Experience Considerations
- Dependencies can be added with a simple search interface to find the blocking task
- Dependencies can be removed with a single click
- The dependency menu shows clear visual feedback about the current dependency state
- Task completion UI prevents completing blocked tasks with appropriate feedback
